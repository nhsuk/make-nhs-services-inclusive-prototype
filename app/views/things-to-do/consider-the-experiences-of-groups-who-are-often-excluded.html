      <h2>Think about who is likely to be or feel excluded from accessing NHS services</h2>

      <p>Anyone can experience barriers to and be excluded from accessing NHS services. These barriers can be long-term  temporary.  Some people are more likely to be affected by barriers and are therefore more likely to be excluded.</p>

      <p>For example, people experiencing several types of inequality and disadvantage will face additional barriers to accessing services.</p>

      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Examples</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A black woman who has had negative experiences with NHS services might be fearful of booking an appointment.</li>
        <li>Parents who work fulltime, have young children and care for an older parent might prioritise taking their children and parents to their health appointments over making their own appointments.</li>
        <li>A woman who has broken her leg would not be able to drive to her physiotherapy appointment for her chronic neck pain.</li>
        <li>A non-binary person who is depressed and sleeps until midday may miss the 10am deadline to call their local mental health support service.</li>
        <li>An older man who lives alone with fewer social connections may not feel able to use digital devices to order a repeat prescription. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ask yourself who could be excluded by your service</h2>
      <p>Teams should take steps to understand which groups of people their service could exclude and how they can be included.</p>
      
      <p>Some groups of people, particularly minority groups, are more likely to be excluded than others. This can be because of their age, abilities, ethnicity, a lack of resources or other circumstances.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">If someone who is pregnant does not identify as a woman, they may feel excluded by breastfeeding content. One NHS website team interviewed trans men who had given birth and are creating new content on chestfeeding for this audience.</p>
      </div>

      <hr>
      <h2>Understand the effect of people experiencing multiple disadvantages</h2>
      <p>Teams should understand that people can experience multiple disadvantages at once and that this can multiply their exclusion from healthcare services.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">Someone who is from an ethnic minority background, experiencing poverty, in a rural area, with a lack of access to transport links, and is fearful of healthcare services experiences multiple barriers to accessing healthcare services.</p>
      </div>
      
      <hr>

      <h2>Understand that disadvantage can be long-term or temporary</h2>
      <p>Teams should understand that people’s experience of inequality and disadvantage can be long-term or temporary. What people can do, or feel able to do, at any given time can vary according to permanent, temporary or situational factors.</p>

      <h2>Do not make assumptions about your users</h2>
      <p>Be aware of your own biases and privilege, so that your design doesn’t just reflect your own lived experiences.</p>
      <p>Carry out user research to make sure your design assumptions are correct.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">Some of our pregnancy content assumed that people were happy about their pregnancy. But a pregnant 15-year-old may not have the same needs as someone who's older with a planned pregnancy. So one NHS website team considered the needs of people with different feelings.</p>

      <h2>Think about social and cultural group dynamics</h2>
      <p>If you're going to do research with a group of people, ask yourself questions like these.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Should I be the person doing this research or will my presence have a negative effect on the process?</li>
        <li>Should I speak to people in smaller groups? Are there power dynamics between people that I need to be aware of?</li>
        <li>Do I know enough about the history of the group? Am I aware of topics or past events that might affect what they want to talk about?</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">A team doing research with Travellers found that women do not want to talk about women's health issues with men in the room and visa versa.</p>

      Use consequence scanning to check the impact of the thing you are building
    </h2>
    <p>Set aside time to actively consider the potential consequences of your work on specific user groups. Take the opportunity to learn from the experiences of other team members who may be part of seldom-heard groups.</p>
    <p>Use consequence scanning to generate action items to add to your backlog.</p>
    <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">Some NHS Digital teams use consequence scanning at the beginning of each project and involve the whole team in this. Other teams have used consequence scanning to look at their entire product and then focussed on a specific piece of work.</p>
