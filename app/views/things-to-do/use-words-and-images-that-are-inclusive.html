        Write for and about people in a way that is inclusive and respectful

        Create your content for a variety of user groups, for example, people with a range of skin tones. Read about making content about skin symptoms more inclusive [link].
      </p>
      <p>
        Check with the people you’re creating content for how they want to be described. Use the inclusive language guide to avoid “othering” or alienating people by mistake. Talk directly to your user.
