      <h2>Write down tasks and scenarios</h2>
      <p>Keep tasks and scenarios as short as possible, without compromising on clarity. Present them to the participants and read through the tasks and scenarios with them. This will make it easier for people with dyslexia and attention deficits to follow.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Include visuals in instructions</h2>
      <p>Where appropriate, provide visual rather than, or in addition to, written instructions. This will make it easier for participants with dyslexia and learning and communication difficulties to follow.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Consider your language</h2>
      <p>Avoid open-ended, vague or hypothetical questions.</p>
      <p>Be aware that some neurodiverse people find idioms or metaphors difficult to understand. Be clear and explicit.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Allow participants to complete scenarios as themselves</h2>
      <p>It's common in user research to ask participants to imagine that they are a fictional person. For example, "Imagine you're Chris, you're 57 years old."</p>
      <p>Some neurodiverse people find abstract thinking difficult. Let them complete tasks and scenarios as themselves.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Split up questions and tasks</h2>
      <p>Some people may become easily overwhelmed or find it difficult to remember large chunks of information. Reduce cognitive load by splitting up tasks and questions into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Use rating scales as a conversation prompt</h2>
      <p>People with some cognitive differences, like learning difficulties, may struggle to understand how to give a rating to indicate their opinion.</p>
      <p>Use rating scales as a conversation point, instead of relying on the number they answer with. Ask participants why they gave that number so they can tell you more about what they're thinking.</p>
