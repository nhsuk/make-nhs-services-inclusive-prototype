      <h2>Test with a broad range of users</h2>
      <p>Make sure the way you recruit participants is as inclusive as possible. Test with people with diverse backgrounds, abilities and experiences.</p>
      <p>Be aware of users' challenges and assistive technology they may be using.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">We tested the NHS website's chickenpox page with people who have a range of skin tones. We also tested it with people with different access needs including users with sight loss, dyslexia, cerebral palsy and a neurological disorder.</p>
      </div>

      <hr>
      <h2>Use HTML prototypes</h2>
      <p>You should test with working HTML prototypes so that you can include people with mobility, cognitive and vision (magnification and screen reader) issues.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">A team used an image-based prototype to test different concepts of a complex new component. The successful concept was created in HTML so it could then be tested with screen reader users.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">They found that screen reader users had difficulty using the component, even though it had previously tested well with sighted users. This could have been observed earlier if those users had been involved in the first round of testing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <hr>
      <h2>Address basic accessibility issues before you start</h2>
      <p>Check that the thing you're testing is technically accessible.</p>
      <p>Read more about <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/user-research#run-technical-tests-for-accessibility-beforehand">running technical tests for accessiblity beforehand</a>.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Before the research session</h2>
      <p>Send information and consent forms ahead of the session, so participants have time to review them, process information and clarify any concerns.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, read through the consent form at the start of the session and get their verbal consent. (Do not forget to record this.)</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Consider going to a more convenient place</h2>
      <p>Sometimes it's better to go somewhere that's more convenient for the person you're researching with, such as their home, or place of work or learning.</p>
      <p>This way they may be able to use their own equipment and software and you can get a better idea of how they would use things in daily life.</p>
      <p>Make sure the space is big enough and accessible enough for your participants.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--content">
        <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">A team went to the University of Leeds to do research with a student who was blind. The participant brought their own laptop and mobile and accessed the prototype on there.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">By doing this they learnt about the student's preferred technology and settings and were also able to observe the environment they were likely to access the service in.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <h2>Give people time</h2>
      <p>Build extra time into the research session:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>for any technical setup</li>
        <li>so you can put people at ease</li>
        <li>so you can make sure you understand the participant's experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be flexible. Neurodiverse participants, for example, may complete tasks faster or slower than neurotypical participants.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Be specific</h2>
      <p>If you're using a recruiter, be as specific as possible about the types of participants you want. Make sure you're happy with the screening questions they're going to use.</p>
      <p>Common pitfalls include confusing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a learning difficulty and a learning disability - find out <a href="https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/learning-difficulties">the differences between a learning difficulty and a learning disability</a> on Mencaps's website</li>
        <li>speech-to-text (for example, Dragon Naturally Speaking) and text-to-speech software (for example, Claro Read)</li>
      </ul>
