      <h2>Test your content with a broad range of users who have diverse backgrounds and abilities</h2>
      <p>Be aware of users' challenges and assistive technology they may be using. Make sure the way you recruit participants is as inclusive as possible. Test with a diverse pool of people from all backgrounds and lived experiences.</p>

      <h2>Tips when conducting research with trans people</h2>
      <p>When you introduce yourself, tell the person your pronouns. This normalises asking for pronouns, and allows everyone to express how they would like to be addressed. Never assume someone’s pronouns.</p>
      <p>Where you might be asking someone to view non-inclusive content, it’s beneficial to give people trigger warnings. This can be as simple as a verbal warning like “We’re going to show you a page on breastfeeding now, which might be triggering. If at any point you need to leave or stop, please do so.” It is important to do this because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People may need to stop and mentally prepare themselves to deal with something that is emotionally harming to them.</li>
        <li>People might not feel able to deal with the content during the session and may have to stop. It’s important that they feel able and supported to do so.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips when conducting research with people living with mental health conditions</h2>

      <h2>Tips when conducting research with neuro-diverse participants</h2>
      <h3>Have tasks and scenarios written down</h3>
      <p>Ensure that tasks and scenarios are kept as short as possible, without compromising on clarity. Present these to the participants and read through the tasks and scenarios with them. This will make it easier for people with dyslexia and attention deficits to follow.</p>
      <h3>Include visuals within instructions</h3>
      <p>Where appropriate, provide visual rather than/in addition to written instructions. This will make it easier for participants with dyslexia, and learning and communication difficulties to follow.</p>
      <h3>Allow participants to complete scenarios as themselves</h3>
      <p>It is common within UX research to ask participants to imagine that they are a fictional person (e.g. “Imagine you’re Chris, you’re 57 years old and you’d like to fly to Malta with your partner, Skye, on 3 December”). These abstract concepts can be difficult for people with certain cognitive impairments to grasp, so it’s preferable to allow them to complete tasks and scenarios as themselves.</p>
      <h3>Split up questions and tasks</h3>
      <p>Some of this user group may become easily overwhelmed or find it difficult to remember large chunks of information. It is therefore important to reduce the cognitive load for participants by splitting up tasks and questions into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>
      <h3>Use rating scales as a conversation prompt.</h3>
      <p>People with certain cognitive impairments, like learning difficulties, may struggle to understand how to provide a rating that is truly indicative of their opinion. However, rating scales can be used as a conversation point with these participants, instead of relying on just the number they answer with. Always asks participants why they gave that number so that they are prompted to discuss their opinions and thoughts further.</p>

      <h2>Tips when conducting research with participants with a motor impairment</h2>
      <h3>Adapt co-creation activities</h3>
      <p>Activities might involve hands on activities, such as cutting out pictures or text and creating collages, or making drawings. These tasks may involve fine motor skills which are difficult to complete for users with motor impairments. It’s therefore important to ensure that there are alternative activities which are also accessible to those who do not have fine motor controls.</p>
      <h3>Have clear tasks and indicators of success</h3>
      <p>For participants with a severe mobility impairment, for example, someone who uses an eye tracker to interact and communicate with others, it may be preferable to rely more heavily on observational data. It’s therefore important to have clear tasks with clear indicators of success at the end of tasks, so that you can easily evaluate whether the tasks were completed successfully, based on observations alone.</p>
      <h3>Ask closed questions and design your research to be more observation based</h3>
      <p>Usually, as user researchers, we like to ask lots of open questions. For participants who are non-verbal and rely on a communication device it can make the research more comfortable for the participant if you do not rely on them giving you lengthy answers but instead rely more on observational data and ask more closed questions. This is not to say that you shouldn’t ask any open questions, but that you may have to adjust the balance of the two.</p>

      <h2>Tips for conducting research with participants with an auditory impairment</h2>
      <h3>Write down any instructions</h3>
      <p>Have instructions written down so that participants can read them instead of you talking to them and them using an interpreter or lipreading. This will be down to personal preference of the participant, however, sometimes reading will take less energy and will be easier for them.</p>
      <h3>Face the participant and speak clearly</h3>
      <p>When talking to someone with an auditory impairment, the following steps will make it easier for them to lip read and understand you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get their attention before you start to speak.</li>
        <li>Face them whilst you’re speaking.</li>
        <li>Don’t cover your mouth whilst you are talking.</li>
        <li>Speak clearly.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Speak directly to them</h3>
      <p>Some deaf people will have an interpreter with them. Although they will be helping you to communicate with the participant, it is best practice (and polite) to speak directly to the participant, not to their interpreter.</p>
      <h3>Offer captions for remote research</h3>
      <p>Deaf people who may ordinarily be OK with lip reading may struggle with this more in a remote research session. It’s therefore best practice to offer subtitles (ideally provided by a panel typist) during a research session.</p>

      <h2>Tips when conducting research with participants with vision impairments</h2>
      <h3>Allow screen reader users to set the speed of the screen reader</h3>
      <p>Allow users to set their screen reader to the speed they usually would use it at home: this will encourage them to engage naturally with the website or app. However, some advanced screen reader users may use their screen reader at such a speed that it is difficult to know what they are doing or what the screen reader announces.</p>
      <p>To get around this, when they discover an issue or if the user becomes confused, ask them to explain the issue and what keys they pressed. If needed, also ask them to slow the screen reader down and show you the issue, so that you can understand what was announced and what happened.</p>
      <h3>Capture keystrokes used by screen reader participants</h3>
      <p>When an issue is identified, as much as possible, record what keystrokes screen reader participants are using to interact with your product. That way you can understand how users are trying to interact with the website, and how they expect it to behave.</p>
      <h3>Use best practice to guide blind participants</h3>
      <p>As a researcher, you may sometimes need to guide blind participants. Best practice is to offer them your elbow for them to hold on to, and to make sure you tell them where you’re going and where things are (e.g. “we’re going through a door; the chair is to your right”).</p>
      <h3>Make sure the space is physically accessible</h3>
      <p>Some blind people may have a guide dog, it is therefore important to ensure that the research space is large enough for them too. It is also good to have a water bowl for the guide dog in the room.</p>
      <h3>Make rating scales accessible</h3>
      <p>If you’re using visual cues (e.g. rating scales) make sure you print them off in large print for those with low vision. For blind participants, make sure that you’re not asking them to remember too much information. For example, with rating scales, don’t tell them what each number stands for (e.g. somewhat/strongly agree/disagree) just tell them what number 1 and number 5 stand for and ask them to pick one in between.</p>
      <h3>Be aware of using colours when using visual prompts</h3>
      <p>When asking users to do things like annotate print outs using different coloured pens, or placing different coloured stickers on print outs, be aware that not all users can perceive colour. Try to use other markers as well as colour. For example, if using stickers, try to find stickers which aren’t only a different colour but also a different shape. If you have any
      documents which you would like participants to read, make sure information isn’t conveyed using colour alone.
      </p>
      <h3>Use HTML prototypes</h3>
      <p>HTML prototypes can be easily tested with screenreader users. Using tools like Figma and Invision is inherently exclusive because they don’t work with screenreaders.</p>


      <h2>[Ahead of the session]</h2>
      <p>Send information and consent forms ahead of the session, so participants have time to review, process information and clarify any concerns/uncertainties. Alternatively, read through the consent form at the start of the session and get their verbal consent (don’t forget to record this).</p>

      <h2>[Another place]</h2>
      <p>Sometimes it may be more beneficial to go to a place that’s more convenient for the person you’re researching with, such as their home, or place of work or learning. This way they can be more able to use their own equipment and software and you can get a much better idea of how they would use things in daily life.</p>

      <h2>[Extra time]</h2>
      <p>Build extra time into the research session to allow for any technical setup, and the extra time it will take for you to build rapport and make sure you understand the participant’s experience.</p>

      <h2>[Be specific]</h2>
      <p>If using a recruiter, be as specific as possible about the types of participants you want and make sure you’re happy with the screener they’re going to use. Some common pitfalls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A learning difficulty is not the same as a learning disability. Read more here: https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/what-learning-disability </li>
        <li>Speech-to-text (e.g. Dragon Naturally Speaking) is very different to text-to-speech (e.g. Claro Read) software</li>
      </ul>
